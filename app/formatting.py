"""Pure, Streamlit-free presentation helpers: fixed short labels for
existing enum values, a severity tally for the top-level summary sentence,
and a read-only knowledge-base entry lookup by the id Agent 3 already
selected.

Nothing here decides anything Agents 1-3 didn't already decide. See
research/UI_DESIGN.md for the design this implements and the specific
constraints on each function (especially kb_entry_by_id, which must not
perform its own matching -- it only resolves an id string Agent 3 already
chose into the full KnowledgeBaseEntry object for display).
