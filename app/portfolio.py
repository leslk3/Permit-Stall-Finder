"""Portfolio triage -- batch analysis across multiple permits, for anyone
who pastes more than one permit number at once (streamlit_app.py decides
single-permit vs. portfolio purely by how many permit numbers came in --
there's no persona gate upstream of this anymore).

Like every other module under app/, this performs no analysis of its own.
Each row is a presentation-layer summary of a PermitAnalysisResult that
orchestration.pipeline.run_pipeline() already produced in full, unchanged
-- run once per permit, exactly the same call the single-permit view
makes. The one piece of logic here, `_max_severity()`, is a plain max()
over Severity values Agent 2 already assigned to that permit's own
detections -- ranking for sort/color order, not a new severity judgment,
the same spirit as formatting.summarize_severity_counts()'s plain count.

run_batch() and render_table() are split apart (rather than one monolithic
render()) so streamlit_app.py can collect permit numbers from either input
path -- a pasted list or an address-search selection -- and feed either
into the same batch-run-and-display logic.
