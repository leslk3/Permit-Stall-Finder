"""Quick-glance horizontal summary card -- shown once at the top of a
completed single-permit analysis (below the persona switcher and any
portfolio table) so the highest-value facts are visible without
scrolling. Every field is read directly off an already-complete
PermitAnalysisResult; this module composes no new interpretation, only
lays out facts Agent 1/2/3 already produced across one row of
st.columns.

Deliberately separate from top_level_result.py (section B): that section
keeps the neutral, no-outcome-color-coding treatment UI_DESIGN.md decision
3 requires for the full-page summary. This card is a denser at-a-glance
strip meant to sit above it, not replace it -- the full section B/C/D/E/F/G
sequence still renders below for anyone who wants the complete picture.
