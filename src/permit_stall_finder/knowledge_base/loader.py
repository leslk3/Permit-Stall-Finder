"""Loads and validates research/agent3_knowledge_base.json, and implements
specific-before-generic lookup (AGENT3_DESIGN.md §3, §9): a detection is
matched against the most specific key available for its category before
falling back to that category's generic entry, and to None
(NO_ENTRY_AVAILABLE) if neither exists. Matching never falls back further
than the category's own generic entry -- there is no cross-category
fallback, since that would be exactly the kind of category-only matching
this design was told to avoid.
