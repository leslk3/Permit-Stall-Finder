"""Persistence for a return user's starred permits/addresses and recent
search history -- so someone who checks the same permit(s) every day for
their job doesn't have to retype a search each time. Same DuckDB
connection and naive-UTC-timestamp convention as storage/snapshots.py
(see that module's _to_utc_naive docstring for why: DuckDB's TIMESTAMP
column silently reinterprets a tz-aware datetime in local time, so
everything here is stored naive-UTC and re-tagged UTC on the way out).

There's no user-account system anywhere in this app, so "starred" and
"recent" are app-wide state, not per-person -- the same scope every other
table in storage/db.py already has. And like permit_snapshots, this data
persists only as long as the deployed app's underlying filesystem does:
it survives across sessions and reruns, but a redeploy/reboot starts it
over, exactly the same caveat that already applies to permit journey
history.
